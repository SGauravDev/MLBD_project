-  Find out the model to train the recommendation dataset , it can vary from anywhere from Agentic model to normal predictive models (AIML).
-  Dataset decided if amazon(kaggle) , Google books (1GB) etc. (team to decide if we going with scraping or not - depends on timelines)
-  we are going with GCP (depends on the credit left) or azure.
-  TBD on GCP cloud run vs cloud functions vs Compute engine (a small POC)
-  Decide on the UI tech stack either flask or react js - we take the input from user (top 5 book they like) - we start recommendation the books.
